        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          My passion for robotics and software began in early childhood. I first discovered programming in the 6th grade,
          writing Python scripts to help with math homework. In high school, I built a self-balancing two-wheeled robot using a LEGO Mindstorms kit.
          I also enjoy driving, riding motorcycles, and fabrication work!

        <h3>Decentralised Drone Swarms!</h3>

          In this project I implemented a complex Laplacian-based controller for a swarm of drones, inspired by a paper I read during my time in an aerial robotics class at UCL.
          The algorithm constructs two graphs: one for accessing the drones' velocities and another for shape control. I then formulated a system of ODEs and
          integrated it using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, allowing for mid-flight formation and scale control.

          There already exists different grasping techniques to pick and place objects, however I thought it would be fun to implement my own! I implemented a custom pipeline to grasp and place square and cross-shaped objects into a box using point cloud data from a depth camera.
          After clustering to find object centers, I applied corner detection for orientation and used a rotation formula for grasp point calculation.
          Shape classification was handled via centroid properties. The entire task was executed using the MoveIt library.

              <h3>Fabrication Work</h3>
        <p>
          These are just some various projects I've worked on in the past, mostly out of my parents' backyard and garage. From learning to MIG weld to making bash bars for my project car with a tube bender, I’ve always enjoyed building things from the ground up.
        </p>

              <h4>TIG Welded Bashbar</h4>
              <p>I made this bashbar for my project car since the bumper was damaged. The car was also meant to be put on a track so it could easily be towed from the rear since it would be directly moutned to the frame.</p>

              <h4>TIG Welded Chopper Exhaust</h4>
              <p>Originally the exhaust on this motorcyle was just facing straight down, I thought it would be cool to have a "wrap" in the exhaust. This project turned out quite hard due to the amount of welding to get the bend right. In the end it worked great and sounded amazing!</p>

              <h4>Custom Seat Mounts</h4>
              <p>In order to put my project car on the track the organizers require atleast a 4 point harness. To do this I had to remove the original seats and make custom seat brackets for the car. I MIG welded the brackets to the floor of the car and made a rollcage to mount the harness onto.</p>
