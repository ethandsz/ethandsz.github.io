        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          My passion for robotics and software began in early childhood. I first discovered programming in the 6th grade,
          writing Python scripts to help with math homework. In high school, I built a self-balancing two-wheeled robot using a LEGO Mindstorms kit.
          I also enjoy driving, riding motorcycles, and fabrication work!

        <h3>Decentralised Drone Swarms!</h3>
        <p>
          In this project I implemented a complex Laplacian-based controller for a swarm of drones, inspired by a paper I read during my time in an aerial robotics class at UCL.
          The algorithm constructs two graphs: one for accessing the drones' velocities and another for shape control. I then formulated a system of ODEs and
          integrated it using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, allowing for mid-flight formation and scale control.

        <h3>Pick and Place</h3>
        <p>
          There already exists different grasping techniques to pick and place objects, however I thought it would be fun to implement my own! I implemented a custom pipeline to grasp and place square and cross-shaped objects into a box using point cloud data from a depth camera.
          After clustering to find object centers, I applied corner detection for orientation and used a rotation formula for grasp point calculation.
          Shape classification was handled via centroid properties. The entire task was executed using the MoveIt library.
