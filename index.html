    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>My passion for robotics and software dates back to my early childhood, where I first learned about code in the 6th grade and starting developing Python scripts to do my math homework. In my high school robotics class I created a self balancing two wheeled robot with a lego mindstorms kit. I also really enjoy driving, riding motorcycles and fabrication! </p>

      <h3>Decentralised Drone Swarms!</h3>
      <p>
In this project I implemented a complex based Laplacian for controlling a swarm of drones. This was inspired from a few papers I was reading during my time in an aerial robotics class as part of my MSc at UCL mainly [link to paper]. The algorithm works by first creating two graphs, one for accesing the drones velocities and another for shape control. I then form an ODE to govern the system and integrate it using the fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme. This allowed me to control the formation and scale mid flight!

      <h3>Pick and Place</h3>
      <p>
        There already exists different grasping techniques to pick and place objects, however I thought it would be fun to implement my own! In this project I aimed to grasp and place square and cross objects into a box using various image processing techniques. The process works by clustering pointcloud data from a depth camera to identify the center of objects. I then use a corner detector to determine the orientation of the objects in space. The grasping point calculation was done by using a rotation about a 2d point formula. Shape classification was a bit simpler since the squares wouldn't have any points in the centroid. Finally, the pick and place task was done using the Moveit library!
