      <h4><a href="projects/project1.html">Decentralised Drone Swarms!</a></h4>
      <p>In this project I implemented a complex based Laplacian for controlling a swarm of drones. This was inspired from a few papers I was reading during my time in an aerial robotics class as part of my MSc at UCL mainly [link to paper]. The algorithm works by first creating two graphs, one for accesing the drones velocities and another for shape control. I then form an ODE to govern the system and integrate it using the fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme.</p>
